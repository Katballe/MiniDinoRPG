Title idea(s): My World, Noobcraft


component based entity system, look it up and maybe change this ( it is currently using an entity system )

Mining = dungoen = 2D platformer w. mining

A game with many paces for yout casual gamer who just wants to chill, build, live, fight and do what the player feels for at the moment. 

The thought is to make a big game.. not big as in a big world, but big as in many opportunities.
