# MiniDinoRPG

The scope of this project is to help me improve my skills and understanding of the Java language.

Current state: 
Mechanics
- A few static object which can be attacked and destroyed. (use arrowkeys for attacking)
- Movement is clunky (haven't spent the time to adjust the bounds, since that isn't the scope of the project at its current state)
- Destoyed items drop loot
- Crafting is implemented. 
  - a two ingredient crafting system 
  - crafting guide/help in-game is not implemented yet
    - Open/close inventory by pressing E
    - Select item for crafting by pressing G over the item 
    - When two items are selected press Y to try crafting an item
    - To deselect all selected items press N
  - a few items can be crafted

World, art and camera
- 1 scene is implemented
- Moving is relative smooth 
- Camera handling is working as intended
- Most tiles are drawn. This wasn't part of the scope of the project, but I wanted to try it
- The dino art is borrowed from https://opengameart.org/content/free-dino-sprites
- The wall and dirt tiles is at the current state also burrowed elsewhere
- Trees are also burrowed elsewhere
